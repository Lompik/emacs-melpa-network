#+TITLE: D3js based network visualization of emacs packages on Melpa

This is a pre-computed d3js force network of the > 3000 melpa's dependency optimized for panning and zooming.

Packages going to ~;none;~ have no dependency listed.

~emacs24~ is actually ~emacs >24~ with a handfull of packages with ~<24~ or wrong version.
